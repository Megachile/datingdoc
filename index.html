        <h2>Who I am and what I'm looking for:</h2>
        <p><strong>Headline:</strong> I'm Adam, a 34 year old PhD student studying biology at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. I'm looking for the love of my life and mother of my kids.</p>
        <p><strong>Relationship goal:</strong> I've been happily single for a long time and I'll continue to be happy on my own as long as I need to be. In the past few years I gained the aspiration to become a lot more than happy: to find someone very special to invest in creating a deeply loving, supportive, transformative relationship that can be the foundation to build a family.</p>
        <p><strong>Location:</strong> I am planning to live in Albuquerque until I finish my Phd (2028-9). My priority is to meet the right person as soon as possible, wherever she lives. I'm not looking for a relationship of convenience. I want someone prepared to take on challenges together. If distance is an obstacle, we'll have video calls and money for visits and trips together and movers when the time comes.</p>

    <h2>Things about me I'm excited to share:</h2>

    <p><strong>Curious:</strong> I love learning about people, the universe, and how things work. I care about getting it right.</p>

    <p><strong>Grateful:</strong> I have been blessed with a wonderful family, befriended many incredible people, and had amazing opportunities, but my biggest blessing has been the attitude to recognize and feel my good fortune.</p>

    <p><strong>Friendly Ambitious Nerd:</strong> I founded <a href="https://www.gallformers.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gallformers.org</a>, built bridges between amateur naturalists and academia, and coded a web tool and a browser extension.</p>

    <p><strong>Gregarious:</strong> I enjoy meeting strangers and feel at ease in varied company. As a teacher and tutor, I can explain complex ideas clearly. In partner dance, people quickly feel at ease with me.</p>

    <p><strong>Introspective:</strong> Prone to overthinking, but I make an effort to reflect on my feelings and how I relate to others.</p>

    <p><strong>Affectionate:</strong> I'm warm, open, and I like my friends to know I like them üôÇ</p>

    <p><strong>Sharp:</strong> I practice attuned, attentive teasing. I hold myself and others to high standards, but relish our many slapstick failures to live up to them.</p>

    <p><strong>Exuberant:</strong> I find a lot of beauty and interest in the world, in the mundane and in the big, old, strange, and grotesque aspects. I love nature and I love human culture as the highest expression of the diversity and intricacy of the natural world.</p>
  
    <p><strong>Positive:</strong> I have an unshakeable sense of personal okayness. I'm optimistic about the future of the world. I trust that the blessings I've received and the effort I'm putting in will continue to compound.</p>

    <h2>New rhythms and textures:</h2>
    <p>For most of my life, I've defined myself by curating and creating an esoteric and ambitious range of art and ideas. I still value that side of myself (see below), but in the last year, my focus shifted toward more connective, expressive, embodied pursuits:</p>
