        <p>I'm Adam, a 34 year old PhD student at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque looking for your help meeting the love of my life and mother of my kids.</p>
        <p>I've been happily single for a long time and I'll continue to be happy on my own as long as I need to be. In the past few years I've opened my eyes to the aspiration to become a lot more than happy: to find someone very special to invest in a deeply loving, supportive, transformative relationship that can be the foundation to build a family.</p>
        <p><strong>Practicality:</strong> I am currently living in Albuquerque and committed to live here for at least another 3 years until I finish my PhD (open-ended after that). I realize this is a significant obstacle, and it makes this gesture a bit of a long shot for the time being. But the relationship I'm looking for isn't one of convenience or happenstance. I want to find someone I can choose to commit to for the long term, to practice overcoming challenges with. If there's a chance I might meet that person a few years earlier, I can't put it off even if it isn't easy.</p>

    <section class="transformation">
      <div class="text-box">
        <p>For a long time, I defined myself by curating and creating an esoteric and ambitious range of art and ideas. In the last year, my priorities shifted to more humble, embodied pursuits. I started lifting weights, running 5ks, dancing six styles a week, perfecting a 10-minute risotto, focusing on nutrition, meditating, and watercolor painting with my mom, niece, and aunt.</p>
