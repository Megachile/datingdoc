        <h2>Intro:</h2>
        <p><strong>Headline:</strong>I'm Adam, a 34 year old PhD student at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque looking for the love of my life and mother of my kids.</p>
        <p><strong>Relationship goal:</strong>I've been happily single for a long time and I'll continue to be happy on my own as long as I need to be. In the past few years I've opened my eyes to the aspiration to become a lot more than happy: to find someone very special to invest in creating a deeply loving, supportive, transformative relationship that can be the foundation to build a family.</p>
        <p><strong>Practicality:</strong> I live in Albuquerque and will be here until I finish my PhD, hopefully in spring 2028. I realize this is a significant obstacle, and it makes this gesture a bit of a long shot for the time being. But the relationship I'm looking for isn't one of convenience or happenstance. I want to find someone I can choose to commit to for the long term, to practice overcoming challenges with. If there's a chance I might meet that person a few years earlier, I can't put it off even if it isn't easy.</p>

<section class="character-traits">
  <div class="text-box">
    <h2>Character traits I have to offer:</h2>

    <p><strong>Curious:</strong> I love to learn about people and about the universe, and I care about getting things right.</p>

    <p><strong>Grateful:</strong> I have been blessed with a wonderful family, befriended many incredible people, and had amazing opportunities, but the biggest blessing is that I've had the right attitude to properly value my good fortune.</p>

    <p><strong>Friendly Ambitious Nerd:</strong> I founded <a href="https://www.gallformers.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gallformers.org</a>, built connections between amateur naturalists and academia, and personally built a web tool and a browser extension.</p>

    <p><strong>Socially competent:</strong> I generally like small talk. I’m a teacher and tutor who can communicate complex ideas well—sometimes. My dance partners seem to quickly feel comfortable with me.</p>

    <p><strong>Introspective:</strong> Perhaps prone to overthinking and overcommunicating, but when it’s relevant, I spend a lot of time reflecting on my feelings and relational behavior.</p>

    <p><strong>Affectionate:</strong> I like to let my friends know I like them 🙂</p>

    <p><strong>Sharp:</strong> I practice attuned, attentive teasing. I hold myself and others to high standards, but relish our many slapstick failures to live up to them.</p>

    <p><strong>Exuberant:</strong> I love to find beauty in the world—especially the big, old, strange, and grotesque aspects. I love human culture as the highest expression of the diversity and intricacy of the natural world.</p>

    <h2>Recent changes:</h2>
    <p>For a long time, I defined myself by curating and creating an esoteric and ambitious range of art and ideas. In the last year, my priorities shifted to more connective, expressive, embodied pursuits:</p>
